# Architecture. (required)
# This will expand any env var you set in the field, e.g. version: ${GOARCH}
# The architecture is specified using Go nomenclature (GOARCH) and translated
# to the platform specific equivalent. In order to manually set the architecture
# to a platform specific value, use deb_arch, rpm_arch and apk_arch.
# Examples: `all`, `amd64`, `386`, `arm5`, `arm6`, `arm7`, `arm64`, `mips`,
# `mipsle`, `mips64le`, `ppc64le`, `s390`
arch: ${GOARCH}

# Platform.
# This will expand any env var you set in the field, e.g. version: ${GOOS}
# This is only used by the rpm and deb packagers.
# Examples: `linux` (default), `darwin`
platform: linux

# Version. (required)
# This will expand any env var you set in the field, e.g. version: ${SEMVER}
# Some package managers, like deb, require the version to start with a digit.
# Hence, you should not prefix the version with 'v'.
version: ${SEMVER}

# Version Schema allows you to specify how to parse the version string.
# Default is `semver`
#   `semver` attempt to parse the version string as a valid semver version.
#       The parser is lenient; it will strip a `v` prefix and will accept
#       versions with fewer than 3 components, like `v1.2`.
#       If parsing succeeds, then the version will be molded into a format
#       compatible with the specific packager used.
#       If parsing fails, then the version is used as-is.
#   `none` skip trying to parse the version string and just use what is passed in
version_schema: semver

# Version Release, aka revision.
# This will expand any env var you set in the field, e.g. release: ${VERSION_RELEASE}
# This is appended to the `version` after `prerelease`. This should be
# incremented if you release an updated package of the same upstream version,
# and it should reset to 1 when bumping the version.
# release: abcd

# Section.
# This is only used by the deb packager.
# See: https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-archive.html#sections
section: default

# Priority.
# Defaults to `optional` on deb
# Defaults to empty on rpm and apk
# See: https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-archive.html#priorities
priority: extra

# Maintainer. (required)
# This will expand any env var you set in the field, e.g. maintainer: ${GIT_COMMITTER_NAME} <${GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL}>
# Defaults to empty on rpm and apk
# Leaving the 'maintainer' field unset will not be allowed in a future version
maintainer: 1stblue.com <hello@1stblue.com>

# Description.
# Defaults to `no description given`.
# Most packagers call for a one-line synopsis of the package. Some (like deb)
# also call for a multi-line description starting on the second line.

# Umask to be used on files without explicit mode set.
#
# By default, nFPM will inherit the mode of the original file that's being
# added.
# This may lead to issues if these files are checkout out in Git, for example,
# as it won't keep all the permissions on fresh checkouts, or if the local
# system has a problematic umask setting.
#
# This setting allows to set the umask for all files that are added to the
# package without a specific file_info.mode set.
